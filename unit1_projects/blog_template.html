				<h2>Week 1</h2>
				<article>
					<p>In this blog post, I'll be talking about my three favorite websites. The sites I picked were chosen due to their creativity, usability and design. Take a look!</p><hr>

					<h3>Twitter</h3>
					<a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/twitter.jpg" height="40%" width="40%"></a>
					</div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>I never considered myself much of a <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> user, but I have always truly admired the website. The reason why I appreciate Twitter over other websites is because of it's simple, yet dynamic interface. Starting a conversation is easy, and the environment makes it feel as if everyone is truly connected. In other social media and discussion websites, there are many groups and other seperations which divide people up, where Twitter is a more directionless forum, causing all kinds of behavior. The website is simple, clean, modern, smooth, and colorful. Something that really makes Twitter great is its trending and hashtag usage, which will notify people of hot topics so they can jump into the conversation. On Twitter, people of all kinds of backgrounds talk together because of its simple, friendly environment and layout. This ease makes it a great way for celebrities to talk to people comfortably online. The short, simple posts that are allowed make it a fun, casual site to conversate, where other social media sites bog down on personal profiles and photos.</p>

					<h3>YouTube</h3>
					<a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/youtube.jpg" height="40%" width="40%"></a></div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>Another website I admire is <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube.</a> Although there are several popular online video websites, there is a reason YouTube is widely considered the defacto one. YouTube makes it fun, easy, and even tempting to upload videos, with its immersive community and international fame. Popular YouTube links have spawned plenty of social memes, news stories, media fodder and sudden celebrities. The videos are incredibly easy to share and embed anywhere you want. They also give you editing features while uploading the video. Something that is really special about YouTube is its <b>partner system</b>, where popular video uploaders play ads on their videos and receive money. Several small companies and young actors and comedians make their paychecks this way. This causes people to really take advantage of YouTube as a way to get their videos out there. Also, with YouTubes live streaming feature, companies and news sources can stream a feed live when it's happening. This website is clean, light, customizable (by allowing you to change the video size), simple, and friendly with an environment of silly, funny YouTube partners and users. The website is user friendly and beautiful, with layout updates constantly to make the best experience and help you find the perfect video to watch next.</p></div>

					<h3>Be Moved - Sony</h3>
					<a href="http://discover.store.sony.com/be-moved/" target="_blank"><img src="images/sony.jpg" height="40%" width="40%"></a></div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>Although not quite a website I would use often, I choose the <a href="http://discover.store.sony.com/be-moved/" target="_blank">Be Moved</a> website by Sony because of it's sheer beauty. This isn't the only website of its type that I love, as many websites that use parallax scrolling and HTML5 are beautiful to me. <i><span style="color:#606060">Parallax scrolling is a technique where background images move at a different speed than foreground images, creating a cool illusion of depth.</span></i> However, I chose this one because the animation and user experience is truly wonderful. For reference, the <a href="http://muse.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Muse</a> website displays different features of parallax scrolling, and is a gorgeous website. The Be Moved website however takes this a step further with beautiful animations and timing, which display and show off their products in a very visually nice manner. The information is presented clearly and the website is easy to navigate with its 'scroll-down' navigation, along with the nice looking navbar to the right. By having these animations play out while scrolling through a website rather than a simple video makes things much more engaging for the viewer. This website is beautiful, straightforward (yet complex in its design), modern and simply cool. There's definitely a certain attitude to the website that shows through the intense animations.</p><div>
