					<p>Shereef's fireside chat was a clarifying and informative session for me, in that it made my expectations more clear. The way he described the course and it's group team mentality is how I pictured things would be, since all signs have been pointing to that since I applied. The effort that is expected from students as well is also what I expected, and I am <b><i>excited</i></b> to put that effort in.</p>

					<p>I found his analogy of the <b>Kitchen and Table</b> interesting and it's definitely something I'd like to stay mindful of. I feel like I'm already in the 'kitchen' mindset, where I want to go in and feel responsible to learn as much as I can; not just expecting to get what I paid for.</p>

					<p>The emphasis that Shereef puts on friendliness and everyone being in this together made me feel good about what is to come, and kind of calmed some nerves. I do admit to having some fears of falling behind in some respects, going too fast in others, or not communicating well due to being somewhat of an introvert. However, the environment described seems to help that, as everyone is working together towards a common goal. I am very excited to see what I can learn, and after already seeing how friendly everyone is and watching this video, I feel that I am a great fit for the environment. I can't wait!</p>
