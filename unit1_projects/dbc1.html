			<h3>About me</h3>

			<p>Hello everyone! I am a graphic designer from New York. I was raised in Plainview on Long Island, and went to school at Northeastern University in Boston. Since then I've been living in Manhattan building <b>webpages</b> and doing design work. However, I want to expand my horizons and start building web <i>apps</i>. I want to build more complex and dynamic projects, and thought that this program would be a perfect fit for me.</p>

			<p>Growing up, I've always loved playing video games with my brother, who is now a software engineer, working on popular games for mobile devices. I have always had the same interests as him, and after witnessing the culture and environment he is in as well as the work he does, I've grown <b>extremely</b> interested in immersing myself in that world. <br>I've always been interesting in learning to code, and now I am going to actually going to <i>do</i> something with that interest.</p>

			<h4>Interests</h4>
			<p>Interests of mine include:
			<div class="lists">
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Drawing</li>
			 	<li>Animation</li>
			 	<li>Playing piano</li>
			 	<li>Watching films</li>
			 </ul>
			</div>
			</p>

			<h5>Reading</h5>
