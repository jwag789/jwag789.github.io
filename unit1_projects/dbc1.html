			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>Hello everyone! I am a graphic designer from New York. I was raised in Plainview on Long Island, and went to school at Northeastern University in Boston. Since then I've been living in Manhattan building <b>webpages</b> and doing design work. However, I want to expand my horizons and start building web <i>apps</i>. I want to build more complex and dynamic projects, and thought that this program would be a perfect fit for me.</p>

			<p>Growing up, I've always loved playing video games with my brother, who is now a software engineer, working on popular games for mobile devices. I have always had the same interests as him, and after witnessing the culture and environment he is in as well as the work he does, I've grown <b>extremely</b> interested in immersing myself in that world. <br>I've always been interesting in learning to code, and now I am going to actually going to <i>do</i> something with that interest.</p>

			<h4>Interests</h4>
			<p>Interests of mine include:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Drawing</li>
			 	<li>Animation</li>
			 	<li>Playing piano</li>
			 	<li>Watching films</li>
			 </ul>
			</p>

			<h5>Reading</h5>
			<p>I'm a huge A Song of Ice and Fire fan, I must say. Although I love all of the books, my favorites in order are:
				<ol>
					<li><b>Book 3</b> - A Storm of Swords</li>
					<li><b>Book 1</b> - A Game of Thrones</li>
					<li><b>Book 5</b> - A Dance With Dragons</li>
					<li><b>Book 4</b> - A Feast For Crows</li>
					<li><b>Book 2</b> - A Clash of Kings</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h6>Goodbye!</h6>
				<p>To end this, I'll leave a link to one of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyVqIkJ69VA" target="_blank">favorite animations</a>, which has inspired me and countless others.<br>
