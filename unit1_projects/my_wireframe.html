		<p>The plan for my web page is to make something very clean and simple. The design elements I want to play with are typography and negative space, and make something that should pop out. I want to put in links to my work, and eventually other elements, but I don't want to use up too much space. I am thinking of a header and footer for now, but I want the container to be 100% for now. I plan to base the page on a fluid layout and make my page responsive.</p>
