					<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>When you are anxious about possible confirming a negative stereotype about your identity, that is what Stereotype Threat is. It's unfortanate that prejudices exist in this world, but certain people do hold them.</p>

					<p>Being Jewish, I have an idea of what it is like to be discriminated because of my background. I luckily haven't had to deal with much of this first hand, as I grew up in mostly diverse/Jewish cities, and I can't say I've dealt with any negative stereotyping myself. However, when I see this type of behavior, I try to ignore it and remember that it has nothing to do with me, and only to do with others prejudices. I don't recall many times where I thought I was in risk of confirming a stereotype for my ethnicity or anything. I've had friends who have dealt with this in their lives though, and they respond to it by ignoring the stereotypes, and not letting it get in the way of who they are. I plan to do this if I ever feel like me or anyone else is feeling stereotype threat. I will tell someone that they should not worry about how they are perceived, because it is not their fault if someone else chooses to hold prejudices. Nobody should judge somebody based on their race, gender, learning style, or anything. If everyone is supportive of each other and look past their differences, everyone will be able to help each other better and benefit.</p>
