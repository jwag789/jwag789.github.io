					<p>This post deals with values that are important to me, advice I've given, and stereotype threat.</p><hr>

					<h3>Values</h3>
					
					<p>Looking at a large list of values, there are a few that pop out to me as having been important throughout my life. Values that stand out to me are close relationships, community, loyalty, and personal development. I've noticed that most of the values I associate with times in my life where I've been the happiest and proudest, mostly have to do with other people. Relationships, community, and loyalty, are all values that deal with interactions with others. I feel this is very important, as it's very important in this life to work with and appreciate others. I've also noted personal development as an important value, because of course it is essential to always try and grow and develop as a person, as a way to enhance yourself along with society.</p>

					<h3>Community</h3>
					<p>An essential value that I've noticed is very important to my life is community. Having a community has always been very benefical to me, and it helps me focus and get motivated. I'm sure this is the same for others too, and with people helping each other, they can make better progress. Just like the peer programming we've done so far in Dev Bootcamp, I've been able to learn a lot more just working with people. Having the community on Google+ and Facebook has been really helpful and a lot of my questions have been answered immediately. Other communities I've belonged to have helped me immensely too, such as in college, my track team in high school, my family, and the city of New York, where I've been able to take advantage of many great meet ups and events to hone my knowledge and skills. In general, on a scale from 1 to 5, I'd say that I'm a 5 of trying to live up to the value of contributing to a community. I've been trying my best to review peoples work, contact people about how they are doing, and chip in, in the best way I can in every community I've been a part of. There's always room for improvement, but I hope that I can be considered helpful amongst my peers. I'd rate myself a a 5 on relationships as I try and keep up with people as often as I can. I'd rate myself a 5 on loyalty because I think that it's extremely important to be honest with someone and have their back. I'd rate myself a 4 on personal development, because I admit I tend to procrastinate. For example I haven't worked out in a few months. But, with Dev Bootcamp's curriculum I'm becoming a lot more focused and motivated.</p>

					<h3>Advice</h3>
					<p>A recent topic I've been asked for advice for was about searching for jobs and thinking of career paths, which isn't surpising in this time. My friend graduated with a design degree like me, and like me he's been unsure of what exactly he wanted to do with it. Where I realized I had discovered a passion for learning code, he stuck the path of a designer, but was trying to focus on a style. He's currently working as a designer in a small business setting, but he finds the style is too strict and they won't let him design the way he wants to. He was thinking of quitting and then looking for a job, and I told him he should search for his job while keeping this one, if just to add more to his portfolio. I told my friend what I believed to be true, and that was to do what you really like best, even if it might be the harder route.</p>

					<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
					<p>When I think about my values, I feel good because I know that I hold to them, and that having values are important. I try and hold many other values than the ones I listed of course, but having values are integral, especially when working with others. I think that the values I hold could help me mediate stereotype threat by reminding me that the connections I make with people in my community will overshadow any kind of stereotype that would be made. Other excercises I can think of while feeling down at my time at Dev Bootcamp would be meditating, talking to a friend or a group of peers, or maybe doing a simple challenge to cool down and have fun with a partner.</p>
