					<p>This blog post goes over different types of variable scope in Ruby. Variable scope defines where you can access a variable in your file. There are different types of variable scope in Ruby which define the scope differently. They use a special character before the variable name to define it.</p><hr>

					<h3>Local Variable</h3>

					</div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>A local variable is a variable that is accessible in the method or loop that it was created in. For example, a variable in an each loop would only be accessible in that each loop, or a variable like an argument in a method can only be used in that method. This is defined by starting with a <b>lowercase letter,</b> or an <b>underscore.</b></p>
					</div>
					<div class="column1">
					<h3>Global Variable</h3>
					<img src="images/scope_global.png"/>
					</div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>A global variable is accessible anywhere in the program. That's right, anywhere at all. This can make things very easy if you want to access something anywhere, however using global variables often is typically discouraged. Since these can be accessed and manipulated anywhere, they can make things complex and difficult to find the source of an error. Global variables are defined with a <b>bling or dollar sign ($).</b></p>
					</div>
					<div class="column1">
					<h3>Instance Variable</h3>
					<img src="images/scope_instance.png"/>
					</div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>An instance variable is a variable that is defined in a class, and then accessible anywhere in a specific instance of an object. For example, if you set an instance variable @sum to your class, each instance you make of that class will have its own sum. When you add to the sum on one instance of the class, it will only affect the sum for that instance, and not any other instance of the class. An instance variable is defined with an <b>at sign.</b></p>
					</div>
					<div class="column1">
					<h3>Class Variable</h3>
					<img src="images/scope_class.png"/>
					</div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>An class variable is similar to an instance variable, in that it is defined in a class. However it is accessible to any and every instance of the object, and is shared between them all. For example, if you have your class variable @@sum in your class, if you add to the sum in one instance of the class, it will add it to all of the instances, as it is a variable that is accessible every instance of the class. A class variable is defined with <b>two at signs.</b></p>
					</div>
					<div class="column1">
					<h3>Constant Scope</h3>
					<img src="images/scope_constant.png"/>
					</div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>A constant is a variable that should not be changed. It is accessible in the class or method that it is defined in, or if it was defined outside a class or module, it is given a global scope. These are good to use if you know that you don't want to change a certain variables value. A constant is defined starting with a <b>capital letter.</b></p>
