					<p>This blog post is about asking questions, and what makes a good question.</p><hr>

					<p>When it comes to asking a good question, you have to keep a few things in mind. A very good strategy when asking a question is to imagine that you are the one answering the question. What information would you be looking for? What kind of context do you need? What are some details that will really help me understand the problem?</p>

					<p>Throughout my preperation for Dev Bootcamp, I've asked the community different questions along with reading others questions. One question that I asked was about the instructions for a Ruby challenge. They were unclear to me because two different pages were saying something different, so I asked my question by explaining what I saw, and giving direct text where I saw the problem, and the exact source. I was very direct, and because of that, I got responses saying that it was a nice catch, and the my_solution file for the project was updated. If I wasn't as direct by explaining exactly what I saw and where, people might not have looked into it.</p>

					<p>There have been other questions I've asked to different people individually as well, and when I do, I always try and include every detail. While looking into the best ways to ask a question though, I realized I was maybe missing some things. I would explain my problem clearly, summarize my question in a title, show them my code after introducing the problem, and using proper grammar. However, I could also show relevant links to problems that are similar to mine, but pointing out how my problem is unique to them. I would explain to them different things I've tried, and try and demonstrate what is happening in throughout the code, while being as short as possible. Asking good questions is an important skill, because there are going to be <i>many</i> questions asked, and to find a good answer, it's going to have to be a good question.</p>
