					<p>In this post, I talk about how I can use my understanding of my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinkin Style</a> to my advantage at DBC.</p><hr>

					<p>My Gregorc Thinking Style is Abstract Random, which completely makes sense to me after looking more into it. I agree with this because I think that I work better when I discuss a problem with people. My experience in Phase 0 so far has been great, but something that would be better is working with other people in the same room. I feel that working with people online has been good so far, but will be better when we are together in the course. Realising this, I am thinking of going to meet ups to prepare myself, and to take advantage of my learning style.</p>
					<p>Considering a fixed vs. growth mindset, I have been trying to apply this to other things in my life. I try not to be intimidated by challenges but encouraged by them, and I try to broaden my horizons on how I learn, and how I tackle a problem. By trying different things, I am able to understand more what is the best way for me to learn.</p>
