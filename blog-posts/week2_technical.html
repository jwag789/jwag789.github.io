				<h2>Week 2</h2>
				<article>
					<p>This blog post will explore the different parts of the CSS Box Model. The CSS Box Model is basically the design that wraps around an HTML element. It includes padding, borders, and margins. But what exactly are the differences between those three?</p><hr>

					<h3>The CSS Box Model</h3>

					</div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>Something that I've always had trouble with when working with HTML and CSS is spacing. I always seem to be playing around with the margins and padding to get something into the right position, without knowing exactly what those changes are doing. By visualing each of your HTML elements as a box, things became much easier for me. Once I realized the differences between the different aspects that make up the design of an element, visualizing and coding up the design becomes much easier. Besides the HTML content, the CSS box model is made up of its padding, borders, and margins. Pictured is my own diagram.</p>

					<div class="column1">
					<h3>Padding</h3>
					<img src="images/csspadding.png"></div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>The padding of an element is space that is between the HTML content (say, a line of text or an image), and the border, or edge of the element. It basically creates extra space between the content and where the content ends. The background color is inherit to the contents background color, to create the effect that just the content area is growing.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column1">
					<h3>Border</h3>
					<img src="images/cssborder.png"></div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>The border of an element is rather self explanatory. It is simply that, a border. It is the end of the visual part of an element, however an element can go beyond a border, which will be discussed below. The border however is the area just around the content and its padding. Its background color is inherit of the color property of the content, although this can be changed along with the border style. Different examples of border styles are dotted, dashed, solid, double, and more. You can also round border edges.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column1">
					<h3>Margin</h3>
					<img src="images/cssmargin.png"></div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>Before I mentioned the space in an element that goes beyond the border. The content and padding and border of an element can all be colored and seen, but the margin can not. It is transparent, and it is used to seperate one element from other elements. It is outside space which does not make the element look any bigger, but is still part of the element, and must be considered when positioning and spacing elements against each other.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column1">
					<h3>In Conclusion...</h3>
					<img src="images/sublime1.png"></div>
					<div class="column2">
					<p>Using padding, borders, and margins wisely will be a great benefit to your website, and by using the CSS box model, visualizing how your elements will be placed on a web page becomes much easier. You will want to use padding to spread your element out and increase the space from your content to the border of the background color. You will use borders if you want to emphasize that seperation between the padding and margins. You will use margins to space one element from another without any color being added. Pictured is an image of how to use the code. As you can see, you can type it to specify a direction, or all four directions in one line, in the order of Top, Right, Bottom, Left. For a border, you can define the size in pixels, the style, and then the color.</p>
